the Ada Coelaboration Initiative
---
AKA ACI

This is the initiative to collaborate on blogs, advocacy and other
things to promote and educate about Ada, THE programming language.

A major field of interest is to develop ADA. (ADA is ancronym for
Aid for DisAbled) Being disabled is not fun; neither is Ada (well.. 
that depends,..). 

**The goal is to minimize suffering among the faithfull**

ADA is the purpose; by Ada.

Motto : *Ada-for-ADA* or *ADA-by-Ada*
