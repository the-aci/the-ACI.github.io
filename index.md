AKA ACI

This is the initiative to collaborate on blogs, advocacy and other
things to promote and educate about Ada, THE programming language.

A major field of interest is to develop ADA. (ADA is ancronym for
Aid for DisAbled) Being disables is not fun neither is Ada. The goal
is to minimize suffering among the faithfull.

ADA is the goal, Ada is the means.
